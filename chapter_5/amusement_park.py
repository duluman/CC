For example, consider an amusement
park that charges different rates for different age groups:
Admission for anyone under age 4 is free.
Admission for anyone between the ages of 4 and 18 is $25.
Admission for anyone age 18 or older is $40.
How can we use an if statement to determine a personâ€™s
admission rate?
